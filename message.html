             I know I am not perfect, but I wanna be everything you dream of.
             I wanna be the man who understand you, not just the big things,
             but the small details too. I want you to tell me what you like, what
             makes you laugh, what make you feel safe. Teach me how to love 
             you and how you want to be loved. I do not want to assume ,I want to know 
             what you need. I want to listen, to learn, your happiness means
             everything to me. And I will never stop trying to be the man 
             who brings it to you. I wanna be the one who shows up for you,
             who get it right, to learn from my mistake. I will always be 
             ready to grow, to change, and to love you deeply than I did 
             yesterday. Tell me your dream, your desire, your fears. And I 
             promise I will be right here. You deserve to be loved in a 
             way that feels right to you. And I am here willing to do 
             whatever it takes to be that person for you, because 
             you are my number one.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüíïüòä love you
